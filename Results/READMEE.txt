File Descriptions

port_stats.csv : Offers per-port detailed statistics for every switch and AP.
                Contains bandwidth utilization (TX/RX Mbps), packet counts, error rates, 
                and available bandwidth. Utilize this file for analyzing traffic patterns,
                identifying congestion points, and monitoring link utilization.

flow_stats.csv: Records all flow rules installed in the network. 
                Each entry contains match criteria, actions, packet/byte counts, 
                and duration. This file helps to learn traffic direction,
                verify controller behavior, and inspect which flows are consuming the
                most resources.

switches.csv : Provides a list of all network devices discovered during monitoring.
               Maps DPIDs to logical names and identifies device types (Switch vs AP). 
               Use this to track device presence and verify network topology.

Reports Directory
The reports/ contains detailed text reports generated in each monitoring cycle:
report_cycle_X.txt : Complete network status report for cycle X. Includes port statistics,
                    bandwidth usage, and flow rule summaries for all devices.
port_connections_cycle_X.txt Full report of port connections showing which devices are
                    connected to each port, including link properties (bandwidth, delay).

Bandwidth Visualization Directory :
The bandwidth_viz/ directory contains graphical representations of bandwidth usage:
bandwidth_DEVICE_cycleX.png : graphs of TX, RX, and available bandwidth for every port on the specified device in cycle X.
